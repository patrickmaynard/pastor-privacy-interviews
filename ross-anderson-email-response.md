Both email and phone calls are about as private as letters are; to
intercept them you need either access to the end points, or special
capabilities to pull the traffic off the backbone / phone network /
postal system (and these special capabilities are typically those of
states).

You can do better with services that are encrypted end-to-end such as
signal, facetime and whatsapp, though even there the law enforcement
and intelligence agencies can compromise your machine or (more likely)
implant a room bug.

Much the same applies to video conferencing, though there your
practical security is down to how well you set up and configure your
platform.

If you're in a country where it's a capital offence to convert then
you need to also worry about whether the fact of encrypted
communication itself could give you away to the local secret police.
See the book chapter I cited earler.

Hope this helps,
