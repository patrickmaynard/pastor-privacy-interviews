-- I'm writing about privacy of faith interactions during the COVID-19 crisis, during which many people are using videoconferencing to talk candidly with their pastors, priests, imams, etc.,. Could you describe how cryptography currently plays a role in making those interactions private?

For any digital communication between two parties--email, text, videoconferencing—whether cryptography plays a role depends on the platform or tool in use and if it offers encryption. Generally speaking, encryption refers to the mathematical process of making a message unreadable except to a person who has the key to “decrypt” it into readable form. End to end encryption (e2e) ensures that a message is turned into a secret message by its original sender, and decoded only by its final recipient, to protect the privacy of people on both ends of the conversion. A videoconferencing app that has e2e encryption wouldn't be easily intercepted or subject to eavesdropping. Zoom is a popular tool these days. Its claims of offering e2e encryption have been called into question recently. The company has responded by improving its encryption standards. You can read about that here:

We have written about how people can tighten their Zoom settings to improve the privacy of their conversations:

-- One focus of my piece is the American EARN-IT bill, which many privacy advocates have said could kill commercial encryption as we know it. Could you describe a bit what the bill does, and why it's potentially dangerous?

You can read about our position on the bill here:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/congress-must-stop-graham-blumenthal-anti-security-bill
Here is a letter we wrote to Congress opposing the bill:
https://www.eff.org/document/eff-earn-it-act-first-amendment-letter-sjc

-- When I brought this story idea up to my editor at Christianity Today, he mentioned that one reason they are wary of covering bills is that those bills often don't get signed into law. If this bill doesn't get signed into law, will the accompanying threat to privacy have gone away?

Can't speculate on whether the bill will be signed or not.
But the DoJ, FBI, and others within the U.S. government have repeatedly attacked the use of encryption over several decades, and recent officials, including FBI Directors Comey and Wray and Attorney Generals Sessions and Barr, have all argued for government backdoors, see
e.g.:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/encryption-balance-2015-review
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/2018-encryption
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019

So we're wary that attacks on encryption will continue even if EARN IT is defeated.


-- If not, who stands to gain from erosion of encryption over time?

The better question is who stands to lose. We all do. The privacy and security of our private communications will be put at risk. Once the government obtains a "backdoor" to break encryption, it's only a matter of time before oppressive regimes, criminal syndicates, and other bad actors do the same. Backdoors put our data (financial records, business secrets, email, web browsing, medical and legal records) and devices (smartphones, computers, and even connected devices like smart watches or webcams) at risk.


-- Advocates for the EARN-IT bill have said that it's mainly about combating child pornography. What is your response to that?

As we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a letter last month, although the EARN IT Act attempts to protect children from online sexual exploitation, an important and laudable goal, it does so by impermissibly regulating online speech. The bill would allow the government to regulate how online service providers operate their platforms and manage user-generated content—the very definition of editorial activity in the Internet age. Just as Congress cannot pass a law demanding news media cover specific stories or present the news a certain way, it similarly cannot direct how and whether online platforms host user-generated content.

-- I'm writing from Berlin, and here in Germany, there's still a lot of collective memory of the period when the East German government listened in and kept tabs on a lot of people. Some people I've talked to have said that in a western society, that's not likely to happen. How would you respond to that assertion?

It has, and is, happening here.
The US government, with assistance from major telecommunications carriers including AT&T, has engaged in massive, illegal dragnet surveillance of the domestic communications and communications records of millions of ordinary Americans since at least 2001.

Law enforcement employs a variety of technology tools to engage in surveillance of communities and individuals, including facial recognition, license plate readers, cell site simulators, and drones.

-- Putting aside government actions for the moment, are some videoconferencing platforms better at privacy than others? Do you have any recommendations for people who want to do faith-based counseling or confessions via video?

We can't make recommendations because everyone's threat model is different. We have published information about privacy issues with some of the most popular platforms:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/what-you-should-know-about-online-tools-during-covid-19-crisis
We also have an in-depth guide to keeping your communications private that includes many basic steps people can take, including assessing the risks of online spying, creating strong passwords, creating a security plan, securing your devices, and much more.

-- What about email? Is there currently any best practice regarding email that a pastor can pass along to a 70- or 80-year-old congregant in order to help boost their online privacy?

As our Surveillance Self-Defense guide says: Often the most privacy-protective way to communicate with others is in person, without computers or phones being involved at all. Because this isn’t always possible, the next best thing is to use end-to-end encryption.
