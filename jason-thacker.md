Patrick,

Here are my comments on virtual church and the EARN IT Act. Let me know if you need anything further. Thanks for reaching out!

Virtual church:

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged nearly every aspect of our society, especially the way that churches are able to minister and gather. By embracing these digital tools, such as video conferencing for gatherings and social tools for personal discipleship, local churches are demonstrating how we can harness technology for the love of God and love of neighbor, as we seek to care for the vulnerable in our society and local communities. 

The nature of the church is an embodied people and the use of technology in these ways do not change the fundamental aspect of gathering together as the body of Christ. If anything, I believe these technologies will create a deeper longing for gathering together as the body of Christ as we worship our resurrected King.

EARN IT Act:

Free expression is at the heart of our society. It is a right secured by the Bill of Rights, and, as with all rights, it comes with the responsibility to honor the dignity and lives of people created in the image of God. We must do all we can to protect the most vulnerable among us, especially children and minors, from the grotesque evils of sexual exploitation and human trafficking even when seeking to balance free expression rights in this new digital environment.
