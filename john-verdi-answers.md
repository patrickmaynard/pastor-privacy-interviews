-- I'm writing about privacy of faith interactions during the COVID-19 crisis, during which many people are using videoconferencing to talk candidly with their pastors, priests, imams, etc.,. Could you describe how cryptography currently plays a role in making those interactions private?

Cryptography is a key technology used to protect the privacy of electronic communications. Leading video conferencing platforms use cryptography to ensure that sensitive video calls cannot be intercepted in transit. Some services go further, providing video conferences that are both protected from interception and cannot be accessed by the platform itself.

-- One focus of my piece is the American EARN-IT bill, which many privacy advocates have said could kill commercial encryption as we know it. Could you describe a bit what the bill does, and why it's potentially dangerous?

The details of the EARN-IT bill are complicated, but the impact of the legislation is clear - it would effectively outlaw strong encryption in the United States. The bill would dramatically reduce the security of sensitive data, from religious video conferences and counseling sessions to online banking transactions and health records.

-- When I brought this story idea up to my editor at Christianity Today, he mentioned that one reason they are wary of covering bills is that those bills often don't get signed into law. If this bill doesn't get signed into law, will the accompanying threat to privacy have gone away?

The EARN IT bill is one part of a decades-long effort by US law enforcement to undermine strong encryption. The bill is neither the first legislative attempt that unwisely seeks to weaken key technical protections for personal data, nor will it be the last. Similar efforts are at different stages in the UK, Europe, and elsewhere.

-- If not, who stands to gain from erosion of encryption over time?

Everyone benefits from strong encryption - consumers, businesses, schools, churches, and government agencies. And law enforcement agencies agree that encryption plays a crucial role in combating crimes like financial fraud. Some law enforcement officials argue that strong encryption poses challenges to criminal investigations; the consensus among experts is that this concern is legitimate in some instances but impacts a small number of investigations.

-- Advocates for the EARN-IT bill have said that it's mainly about combatting child pornography. What is your response to that?

The best thing the US Congress could do to combat child abuse and exploitation would be to increase funding for law enforcement investigations into those crimes. Experts in the field note that police lack the resources to fully investigate all the reports of child pornography they currently receive. Increased funding for those investigations would be more impactful than the EARN IT bill and would not pose the cybersecurity risks raised by the bill.

-- I'm writing from Berlin, and here in Germany, there's still a lot of collective memory of the period when the East German government listened in and kept tabs on a lot of people. Some people I've talked to have said that in a western society, that's not likely to happen. How would you respond to that assertion?

The Snowden disclosures and other revelations regarding government surveillance around the globe suggest that technical safeguards are some of the most effective ways to protect against inappropriate government surveillance. 

-- What about email? Is there currently any best practice regarding email that a pastor can pass along to a 70- or 80-year-old congregant in order to help boost their online privacy?

Email is inherently insecure in transit, and few parishioners are well situated to secure it. The two most effective things a pastor could recommend are: 1) use an encrypted text messaging app like iMessage, WhatsApp, or Signal; or 2) make sure they set a strong email password; some cybersecurity risks can arise from family, friends, or colleagues, and a strong password is an important safeguard against those risks.

-- Thank you for talking with me.

Thanks for the thoughtful questions!
