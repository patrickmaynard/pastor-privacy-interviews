Patrick, sorry to keep you waiting. Answers below, thanks mostly to Ash:

-- I'm writing about privacy of faith interactions during the COVID-19 crisis, during which many people are using videoconferencing to talk candidly with their pastors, priests, imams, etc.,. Could you describe how cryptography currently plays a role in making those interactions private? 

    Whatever protections religious leaders are supposed to enjoy in their communications in each country, in practice, they're an easy target for bad actors from hackers to repressive governments. Cryptography protects them just as it protects journalists. It's particularly important for religious minorities -- including, in many countries, Christians -- who may be oppressed by their governments, or targeted by their neighbors. 

-- One focus of my piece is the American EARN-IT bill, which many privacy advocates have said could kill commercial encryption as we know it. Could you describe a bit what the bill does, and why it's potentially dangerous?

    The EARN IT Act would allow the Attorney General to force companies to compromise the security of their products and the privacy of law-abiding users. For nearly three decades, U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been trying to restrict the private sector’s use of encryption. In 2011, Congress considered requiring tech companies to retain extensive logs of user activity, but abandoned the idea after a popular backlash. Courts have repeatedly blocked efforts to mandate age-verification online because it restricts anonymous speech. But the EARN IT Act would give the DOJ a short-cut, presenting Congress with de facto legal mandates that lawmakers would never pass on their own. Even if the bill's commission never issues formal recommendations, the fear of litigation will force many of the services relied on for private, secure messaging to build in backdoors for law enforcement. This goes far, far beyond addressing the shortcomings of today’s system of handling CSAM. It would mean giving a blank check to law enforcement to ban strong encryption, require extensive data retention, age-gate users, and much, much more. That will make users vulnerable around the world, not just to the U.S. government, but to all governments, including those that persecute Christians and other religious minorities

-- When I brought this story idea up to my editor at Christianity Today, he mentioned that one reason they are wary of covering bills is that those bills often don't get signed into law. If this bill doesn't get signed into law, will the accompanying threat to privacy have gone away?

    There was a very well coordinated push behind the EARN IT Act: the timing of the release of the text and the hearings that quickly followed made clear that Senators Graham and Blumenthal are very committed to its passage. No one can predict what will happen in our new reality, but the political weight of these Senators and their obsession with using this vehicle to push their respective agendas is quite real. Even if this bill stalls during the coronavirus crisis, we won’t stop seeing populists in Congress propose things like this.

-- If not, who stands to gain from erosion of encryption over time?

    First and foremost, bad actors: hackers, cyber terrorists, hostile foreign countries. Law enforcement has a strong interest in undermining encryption to make their jobs easier (while violating our due process and privacy rights).



-- Advocates for the EARN-IT bill have said that it's mainly about combatting child pornography. What is your response to that?

    This bill won’t remedy chronic under-funding of CSAM enforcement. The EARN IT Act could actually make law enforcement’s job significantly harder by ending today’s close cooperation between law enforcement and tech companies. Child protection advocates are frustrated that current law leaves it up to companies to decide how to report CSAM to NCMEC, the clearinghouse created to intermediate between tech companies and law enforcement. But Congress consciously chose to make this system voluntary for a good reason: compelling companies to handle reports in specific ways risks converting them into ‘government actors’ for Fourth Amendment purposes. That would mean courts would have to issue a warrant before nominally private companies could ‘search’ private communications. The EARN IT Act’s Rube-Goldberg-esque structure reflects a calculated attempt to circumvent the Fourth Amendment by dressing up what will effectively be legal mandates as mere ‘best practices.’ There’s good reason to think courts will see through this sham. If they do, today’s largely effective system for policing CSAM will come crashing down overnight — and those convicted of generating, disseminating and consuming CSAM could walk free.

    We strongly support protecting children through vigorous enforcement of existing laws. During the EARN IT Act hearing the Senators all acknowledged the lack of funding and resources for investigating these horrific crimes, but for some reason, EARN IT didn’t include any funding for law enforcement. This bill is a ploy to get more power into the hands of the DOJ. 


-- I'm writing from Berlin, and here in Germany, there's still a lot of collective memory of the period when the East German government listened in and kept tabs on a lot of people. Some people I've talked to have said that in a western society, that's not likely to happen. How would you respond to that assertion?

    Just last month, the DOJ Inspector General came out with a report that said that, out of the 25 cases of FISA applications he looked into, none of them satisfied the evidentiary standard, but surveillance was approved in each case. We don’t need to go back in time to find examples of surveillance authorities and programs that are being used by law enforcement agencies in an unconstitutional way.

-- Putting aside government actions for the moment, are some videoconferencing platforms better at privacy than others? Do you have any recommendations for people who want to do faith-based counseling or confessions via video? 

    Look at tools that are encrypted or password protected (or both!)

-- What about email? Is there currently any best practice regarding email that a pastor can pass along to a 70- or 80-year-old congregant in order to help boost their online privacy? 
Email wasn't designed to be a secure protocol. There are ways to do it, but it's a pain. For users who aren't tech savvier, it would be easier just to use a tool designed to be fully secure, like Whatsapp, for anything truly sensitive.
